Our Node.js API is designed to send an email notification whenever a client logs in. Built with advanced SOLID principles and a "packaged by feature" approach, this API ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of understanding. By adhering to SOLID, we've created a robust system where each class and module has a single responsibility, dependencies are injected to promote flexibility, and the interface segregation and Liskov substitution principles are diligently applied to maintain coherence and reliability across the codebase. The "packaged by feature" organization enhances the modularity, making it straightforward to manage and extend specific functionalities independently.
